    excerpt: "Learn how to leverage TypeScript's powerful type system to build more robust and maintainable React applications.",
    content: `# Building Modern React Applications with TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool for React developers who want to build large-scale, maintainable applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to effectively use TypeScript with React to create robust, type-safe applications.

## Why TypeScript with React?

TypeScript brings several benefits to React development:

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
2. **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
3. **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation
4. **Improved Refactoring**: Safe and reliable code changes

## Setting Up Your Project

The easiest way to start a new React TypeScript project is using Create React App:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
\`\`\`

## Component Types

Let's look at different ways to type React components:

### Function Components

\`\`\`tsx
interface Props {
  title: string;
  count: number;
  onIncrement: () => void;
}

const Counter: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, count, onIncrement }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

### Component with Children

\`\`\`tsx
interface CardProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Card: React.FC<CardProps> = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Hooks with TypeScript

TypeScript works seamlessly with React hooks:

### useState

\`\`\`tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
\`\`\`

### useEffect

\`\`\`tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUser = async () => {
    try {
      const userData = await api.getUser(userId);
      setUser(userData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    }
  };

  fetchUser();
}, [userId]);
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use strict TypeScript configuration**
2. **Define interfaces for props and state**
3. **Leverage type inference when possible**
4. **Use generic types for reusable components**
5. **Type your API responses**

## Conclusion

TypeScript and React make a powerful combination for building modern web applications. The type safety and developer experience improvements make it worth the initial learning curve.

Start small, gradually add types to your existing React projects, and you'll soon appreciate the benefits TypeScript brings to your development workflow.`,

    title: "Designing Accessible Web Interfaces",
    excerpt: "Learn the principles and best practices for creating web interfaces that are accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.",
    content: `# Designing Accessible Web Interfaces

Creating accessible web interfaces isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about building inclusive experiences that work for everyone. This guide covers essential principles and practical techniques for accessible design.

## Understanding Web Accessibility

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with web content effectively.

### Who Benefits from Accessibility?

- **People with visual impairments** (blindness, low vision, color blindness)
- **People with hearing impairments** (deafness, hard of hearing)
- **People with motor impairments** (limited dexterity, paralysis)
- **People with cognitive impairments** (dyslexia, ADHD, autism)
- **Everyone using different devices or in challenging environments**

## The Four Principles of Accessibility (POUR)

### 1. Perceivable
Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive.

**Implementation:**
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations
- Offer captions for videos

### 2. Operable
Interface components must be operable by all users.

**Implementation:**
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Don't use content that causes seizures
- Help users navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable
Information and UI operation must be understandable.

**Implementation:**
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies.

**Implementation:**
- Use valid, semantic HTML
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers
- Follow web standards and best practices

## Practical Implementation

### Semantic HTML
Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose:

\`\`\`html
<!-- Good: Semantic structure -->
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
    <p>Article content...</p>
  </article>
</main>

<!-- Bad: Non-semantic structure -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="link">Home</div>
    <div class="link">About</div>
  </div>
</div>
\`\`\`

### ARIA Labels and Roles
Enhance HTML semantics when needed:

\`\`\`html
<!-- Descriptive labels -->
<button aria-label="Close dialog">Ã—</button>

<!-- Form labels -->
<label for="email">Email Address</label>
<input type="email" id="email" required aria-describedby="email-help">
<div id="email-help">We'll never share your email</div>

<!-- Navigation landmarks -->
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <!-- navigation links -->
</nav>
\`\`\`

### Color and Contrast
Ensure sufficient contrast ratios:

\`\`\`css
/* Minimum contrast ratios */
/* Normal text: 4.5:1 */
/* Large text (18pt+): 3:1 */
/* UI components: 3:1 */

.high-contrast-text {
  color: #212529; /* Dark gray on white */
  background-color: #ffffff;
}

.accessible-button {
  background-color: #0066cc;
  color: #ffffff;
  border: 2px solid #004499;
}

.accessible-button:focus {
  outline: 3px solid #ff6b35;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
\`\`\`

### Keyboard Navigation
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

\`\`\`css
/* Visible focus indicators */
button:focus,
a:focus,
input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Skip to main content link */
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 6px;
  background: #0066cc;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 6px;
}
\`\`\`

## Testing for Accessibility

### Automated Testing Tools
- **axe-core** - Browser extension and API
- **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools
